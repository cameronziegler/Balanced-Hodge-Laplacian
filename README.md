The Jupyter notebook here is meant as a companion to the paper "Balanced Hodge Laplacians optimize consensus over simplicial complexes" [currently unpublished]. With the use of the Balanced Hodge Laplacian, we have developed the BHL-1 consensus algorithm. This notebook allows you to create (or load preset) simplicial complexes (of dimension 2) and run the BHL-1 consensus on them. Nearly all of the figure from the paper can be replicated here. As written, this notebook will reproduce those plots exactly. Feel free to try out the plots with different simplicial complexes. The presetSC() function can create about 20 different simplicial complexes, and you can create your own as well.
